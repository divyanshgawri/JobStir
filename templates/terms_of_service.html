                <p>Welcome to JobStir ("we," "us," or "our"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our AI-powered recruitment platform (the "Service"). By creating an account or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

                <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
                <p>Our Service provides an automated platform for candidates and HR personnel. Key features include AI-powered resume parsing, knockout criteria generation, candidate evaluation scoring, and automated communications. The Service is designed to assist in the recruitment process, but all final hiring decisions are the sole responsibility of the HR users.</p>

                <h2>2. User Accounts</h2>
                <p>The Service is available to two types of users: Candidates and HR Personnel.</p>
                <h3>2.1. Candidates</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You may create an account to apply for job postings.</li>
                    <li>You are responsible for the accuracy and truthfulness of the information provided in your resume and application.</li>
                    <li>You understand that your resume and application data will be processed by our AI engine and shared with the HR personnel of the jobs you apply for.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>2.2. HR Personnel</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You may create an account to post jobs and manage candidates.</li>
                    <li>You are responsible for the content of the job descriptions you post.</li>
                    <li>You understand that the AI-generated scores and feedback are tools to assist your evaluation process and do not constitute a final hiring decision. You are solely responsible for your hiring choices.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. The Role of the AI Engine</h2>
                <p>Our Service utilizes a sophisticated AI engine to analyze and process data. You acknowledge and agree to the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Guarantee of Accuracy:</strong> While we strive for high accuracy, the AI's analysis, scores, and feedback are provided "as-is" without any guarantee of correctness or completeness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assistive Tool:</strong> The AI is an assistive tool. It is not a substitute for professional human judgment. HR Personnel must independently verify candidate information and make their own hiring decisions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> We are not liable for any hiring decisions, career outcomes, or other consequences resulting from reliance on the AI-generated content.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. User Responsibilities and Acceptable Use</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Uploading false, misleading, or fraudulent information.</li>
                    <li>Attempting to interfere with the proper working of the Service or its security measures.</li>
                    <li>Scraping, data-mining, or reverse-engineering any part of the Service.</li>
                    <li>Using the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Content Ownership</h2>
                <h3>5.1. Your Content</h3>
                <p>You retain ownership of the content you upload, such as resumes and job descriptions ("User Content"). However, by uploading User Content, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, process, and display that content for the purpose of providing the Service.</p>
                <h3>5.2. Our Content</h3>
                <p>All other content, including the AI-generated analysis, software, and branding, is the exclusive property of JobStir.</p>

                <h2>6. Termination</h2>
