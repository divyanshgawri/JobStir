By analyzing the descriptions or comments, businesses can identify which product the customer is referring to, helping companies improve their product categorization, inventory management, and customer service.\n\n## Features\n**Features**\n**Category Prediction:** Predicts the primary category of the product based on the description provided by the user.<br>\n**Sub-category Prediction:** Identifies the specific sub-category within the main category for more detailed product classification.\n**Text Preprocessing:** Handles text cleaning, including URL removal, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization for improved model accuracy.<br>    \n**Scalability:** The system is designed to scale and work with large datasets for e-commerce platforms.\n**Accuracy:** The model uses advanced machine learning techniques for accurate classification of product descriptions.\n\n## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nBefore building the model, we performed some **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to better understand the dataset and its structure. Below are a few visualizations that highlight important aspects of the data:\n\n### 1. Revenue Share in Sales by Category\n![Revenue Share by Category](https://github.com/divyanshgawri/E-commerce-Product-Description-Analysis/blob/main/output1.png)\n\nThis chart shows the revenue distribution across different product categories.

Most Number of Products Sold by Categories]\n![Products Sold by Categories](https://github.com/divyanshgawri/E-commerce-Product-Description-Analysis/blob/main/output4.png)\n\nThis plot represents the number of products sold across various categories. It provides a comparison of the sales volume for different categories and helps identify the most popular categories.\nHere's an example of how you can describe your **NLP model** in the **README.md** to highlight its functionality and contributions to the project.\n\n## NLP Model for Product Categorization\n\nIn this project, we developed a **Natural Language Processing (NLP) model** aimed at predicting the **category** and **sub-category** of a product description provided by a consumer. The goal was to automate product categorization and enable businesses to analyze customer feedback or product reviews more effectively. The model helps companies identify which product a user is referring to based on their description, improving customer service, inventory management, and overall business intelligence.\n\n### **Model Overview**\nThe model uses **text data** (descriptions of products) as input and classifies them into predefined **categories** and **sub-categories** based on their content. This approach is particularly beneficial for businesses looking to analyze large volumes of product-related content, such as reviews or descriptions, and gain insights into which products are being talked about.\n\n### **Steps Taken:**\n1. **Data Preprocessing**: \n   - Cleaned the text data by removing unnecessary elements such as URLs, special characters, and stop words.\n   - Applied **tokenization**, **lemmatization**, and **lowercasing** to standardize the text.\n   - Used **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert the cleaned text into numerical vectors that the model can process.\n\n2. **Model Selection**:\n   - We experimented with multiple **classification models** like **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** to identify the best model.\n   - Then we Selected **Logistic Regression** as our model for training.\n   - The model takes the cleaned text and predicts the most probable category and sub-category using the trained classifier.\n\n3. **Evaluation**:\n   - The model's performance was evaluated using **accuracy** and **precision** metrics.\n   - Cross-validation was performed to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability across unseen data.\n\n4. **Result**: \n   - The final model is capable of classifying product descriptions with high accuracy. Businesses can now use this model to categorize products automatically based on customer-generated content such as descriptions, reviews, and feedback.\n\n### **Features:**\n- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, removal of stop words, special characters, and URLs, and lemmatization.\n- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts textual data into a format suitable for machine learning models.\n- **Model Flexibility**: Multiple machine learning models can be tested and evaluated for best performance.\n- **Easy Integration**: The model can be integrated into existing product feedback systems or customer service platforms.\n\n### **Future Improvements**:\n- **Deep Learning**: The current model is based on classical machine learning techniques. Future work can involve training deep learning models like **LSTM** or **BERT** for better accuracy and handling more complex language patterns.\n- **Domain-Specific Models**: Creating models tailored for specific industries, such as health or beauty, can improve the model\u2019s ability to handle niche products.\n- **Multilingual Support**: The model can be enhanced to work in multiple languages, making it scalable across regions and countries.\n\n---\n\nThis section of your README will provide clear context for your NLP model, detailing its purpose, methodology, and usage for potential collaborators or employers reviewing your project.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to adjust any details or add more explanations!\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nTo run this project, you need to have Python and pip installed on your system.\n\n### Setup\n\n1.

Specifically, the candidate's lack of experience in data analysis, data visualization, and statistical techniques, as well as their limited exposure to data modeling and relational databases, make them less competitive for this role.\n\nTo improve, Chandr could focus on gaining experience in data analysis, including working with large datasets, developing dashboards and reports, and performing exploratory data analysis. They should also consider acquiring skills in data visualization tools such as Tableau, Power BI, or Looker. Additionally, they could benefit from learning statistical techniques such as regression, clustering, and forecasting to support business initiatives. By acquiring these skills, Chandr would be better positioned to compete for data analyst roles in the future.",

Specifically, you lack hands-on experience with data visualization tools, statistical techniques, and data modeling, which are crucial for this position. Additionally, your skills in Python are not specifically applied to data analysis, but rather to NLP and AI tasks.\n\nTo improve, I would suggest focusing on building projects that involve data analysis, visualization, and modeling. You could explore working with datasets from Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or other sources to develop your skills in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and data visualization using tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Excel. This would help you to demonstrate your ability to work with data and extract insights, which is essential for a Data Analyst role.\n\nFurthermore, consider taking online courses or certifications that cover data analysis, statistics, and data modeling to fill the gaps in your skills. This would enable you to communicate more effectively with business stakeholders and deliver data-driven solutions. By focusing on these areas, you can strengthen your candidacy for similar roles in the future.",

Additionally, the candidate's experience working with specific tools such as WatsonX, langchain Watson Studio, Azure Machine Learning, AWS Sagemaker, and Amazon Bedrock was limited.\n\nTo improve, Divyansh should focus on gaining more experience with LLMs and other neural networks, as well as working with the specific tools mentioned in the job description. He could also work on developing projects that integrate both statistical and AI-based models to demonstrate his ability to design and implement AI models using Python. Furthermore, he should highlight his experience with text preprocessing, keyword extraction, and rule-based logic, as these skills are relevant to the job description. By acquiring these skills and highlighting his experience, Divyansh can better fit similar roles in the future.",
